    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> December 26, 2025</p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>CalcVerse 360+</strong> ("the App"), developed by
      <strong>Rafhan Chaudhary</strong> under the developer account <strong>Skyloop apps</strong>,
      collects, uses, and protects information when you use the App.
    </p>

    <div class="note">
      <strong>Summary:</strong> We do not ask you to create an account and we do not collect information like your name,
      email, contacts, or precise GPS location. The App shows ads using <strong>Google AdMob</strong>, and AdMob may collect
      certain identifiers and device information to display and measure ads. Where required (e.g., EU/EEA/UK/Switzerland or
      California), we use Google’s <strong>User Messaging Platform (UMP)</strong> to request and manage consent/choices.
    </div>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      The App does <strong>not</strong> require login or personal details. We do not collect your name, email address,
      home address, phone number, or contacts.
    </p>

    <h2>1.1 Automatically Collected Data</h2>
    <p>The following data may be collected automatically (directly by us and/or through third-party SDKs like AdMob):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Device model and operating system version</li>
      <li>App activity and basic usage analytics (e.g., screens opened, feature usage)</li>
      <li>Approximate location (derived from IP or device region; <strong>not</strong> precise GPS)</li>
      <li>Crash logs and performance diagnostics</li>
      <li>Advertising identifiers (e.g., Advertising ID) and ad interaction events</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>1.2 Calculator Inputs</h2>
    <p>
      Values you enter into calculators (e.g., percentage, unit conversion, currency conversion, math/finance tools)
      are processed <strong>locally on your device</strong>. We do not store or transmit your calculator inputs.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Third-Party Services We Use</h2>

    <h2>2.1 Google AdMob (Advertising)</h2>
    <p>
      The App uses <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to display ads. AdMob (Google) may collect and process information such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Advertising ID / device identifiers</li>
      <li>Device information (model, OS, language, network type)</li>
      <li>Approximate location (non-GPS)</li>
      <li>IP address (typically used for approximate location, fraud prevention, and diagnostics)</li>
      <li>Ad performance and interaction data (e.g., impressions, clicks)</li>
      <li>Diagnostics and crash/performance information related to ad delivery</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This information may be used to:
      (a) serve ads (including contextual or personalized ads, depending on your choices and region),
      (b) measure ad performance, and
      (c) prevent fraud and abuse.
    </p>

    <p class="small">
      <strong>Note:</strong> AdMob is a third-party service. Google’s data use depends on its policies and your settings.
      You can learn more in Google’s privacy information.
    </p>

    <h2>2.2 Cookies, SDKs, and Similar Technologies</h2>
    <p>
      Third-party partners (including Google via AdMob) may use SDKs, cookies (where applicable), and similar technologies
      such as mobile advertising identifiers (MAIDs) to collect information about your device and interactions with ads.
      This helps provide ads, measure performance, and reduce fraud.
    </p>

    <h2>2.3 Currency Conversion API</h2>
    <p>
      For live exchange rates, the App may send only the currency pair (e.g., USD → PKR) to an exchange-rate provider.
      No calculator inputs, personal identifiers, or contacts are intentionally transmitted for this feature.
    </p>

    <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>We use non-personal/technical information to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Improve app performance and stability</li>
      <li>Fix crashes and bugs</li>
      <li>Enhance calculator features</li>
      <li>Display ads and measure ad performance</li>
      <li>Detect and prevent fraud/abuse</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>We do not sell your personal information.</strong></p>

    <h2>4. Legal Bases (GDPR / UK GDPR)</h2>
    <p>
      If you are in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom, or Switzerland, we process information under the following
      legal bases (as applicable):
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Consent</strong> (e.g., for personalized advertising where required)</li>
      <li><strong>Legitimate interests</strong> (e.g., app security, fraud prevention, basic analytics, non-personal performance measurement)</li>
      <li><strong>Compliance with legal obligations</strong> (where required)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Consent Management (UMP) – GDPR & CCPA Regions</h2>
    <p>
      The App uses Google’s <strong>User Messaging Platform (UMP)</strong> to show a consent/choices form to users in regions
      where it is required (such as the EEA/UK/Switzerland under GDPR and certain U.S. states such as California).
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>If required, the consent form will appear automatically when you use the App.</li>
      <li>You can choose whether ads may be personalized or limited to non-personalized/contextual ads (where available).</li>
      <li>You can change your choices later by using the consent settings available inside the App (if provided) or by resetting
          advertising ID / privacy settings on your device.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="note">
      <strong>Tip:</strong> If you don’t have an in-app “Privacy/Consent” button yet, add one that triggers UMP’s
      “privacy options” flow (Google recommends offering a way to revisit choices).
    </div>

    <h2>6. Your Choices and Controls</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Personalized Ads:</strong> You can limit ad personalization via your device settings (Google settings / Ads settings).</li>
      <li><strong>Advertising ID:</strong> You can reset or delete your advertising ID in your device privacy settings.</li>
      <li><strong>Stop Collection:</strong> Uninstalling the App stops data collection by the App.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Your Rights (GDPR)</h2>
    <p>If you are in the EEA/UK/Switzerland, you may have rights such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Access to your information</li>
      <li>Correction of inaccurate information</li>
      <li>Deletion (where applicable)</li>
      <li>Restriction or objection to processing (where applicable)</li>
      <li>Data portability (where applicable)</li>
      <li>Withdraw consent at any time (where processing is based on consent)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      To exercise these rights, contact us at the email address below. If a request relates to AdMob/Google processing,
      we may direct you to Google’s controls where appropriate.
    </p>

    <h2>8. California Privacy Notice (CCPA/CPRA)</h2>
    <p>
      If you are a California resident, you may have rights under the CCPA/CPRA, including the right to:
      know what personal information is collected, request deletion, correct inaccurate information, and opt out of
      the “sale” or “sharing” of personal information (as those terms are defined by California law).
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information:</strong>
      We do not sell personal information for money. However, advertising-related data sharing for cross-context behavioral
      advertising may be considered “sharing” under California law. Where applicable, you can opt out using the choices provided
      in the UMP consent/choices form and/or your device privacy settings.
    </p>

    <p>
      To submit a request (know/delete/correct/opt-out), contact us at the email address below. We may need to verify your request.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      We may share information with service providers and partners only as needed to operate the App, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Google (AdMob) for ad delivery, measurement, and fraud prevention</li>
      <li>Analytics / diagnostics tools (if enabled) for crash reporting and performance monitoring</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We do not share calculator input values because those are processed locally and not transmitted by us.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      We do not store your calculator inputs. For advertising/diagnostics data collected by third parties (e.g., AdMob),
      retention is controlled by those providers according to their policies.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      We take reasonable steps to protect information. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.
      Since the App does not store personal account data, privacy risk is reduced.
    </p>

    <h2>12. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The App is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
      If you believe a child has provided personal information, contact us and we will take reasonable steps to delete it.
    </p>

    <h2>13. International Users</h2>
    <p>
      If you use the App from outside your country, your information may be processed in countries where our service providers
      operate (for example, where Google processes ad-related data). We rely on appropriate safeguards where required by law.
    </p>

    <h2>14. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The updated version will be posted on this page with a new “Last Updated” date.
      Your continued use of the App after changes means you accept the updated policy.
